        I don't care if they may say insanity <br>I'm nit sure if there is such possibility
        <br>-Of such uncertainty <br>But I request to make it like probability <br>
        -The union of me and you a unity
        '</p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s2">
        The Sun rules the day, 
        you rule my heart <br>And now I can't initiate a flicker of move
      </p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s3">For it excruciates my pain <br> 
        Any attempt to deviate my mind away from you</p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s4">From you stars reflect their beauty <br>
        Making the work of art an easy,
        the sky above a shiny <br> 
        -A shiny roof above the wall</p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s5">The wall suffers a pain in the terrible hands of terrors <br>
        Who broke some mirrors <br>
        And now it cries out for peace <br>
        -The one I've found in you</p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s6">In you I have seen a value more valuable than a jewel <br>
        None of those boys who chat with you in the night <br>
        Can appreciate in your absence</p>
      <p class="stanza" id="s7">Your absence makes my world blank <br>
        But your presence makes me lost <br>
        -In imagining how God is wonderful <br>
        Creating a creature a beautiful <br>
        More beautiful than beautiful</p>
